Goal: 
- input: dataset with all the associated tracks of a potential B0 or Bs decay (without the signal tracks)
- output: probabilities whether the signal particle was a B0 or a Bs meson

Preprocessing (on training data):
- Merge the 2 mc datasets (shuffled, attention on the event ids)
- Select only mc events with certain attributes (B_BKGCAT==0 or ==50, B_IPCHI2_OWNPV<16, B_DIRA_OWNPC>0.9999)
- Select only relevant features
- Generate extra features
- save as new file (in /ceph/users/nguth/bachelor_project_data)

Classification process:
- Preprocess the datasets
- Classify SameSide tracks using a bdt
- process the track data of the sameside tracks
- Classify B0 and Bs using a neural net
